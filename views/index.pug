  h3 Welcome!
  p The Pixie Encounter Tool is a multi-component system for running RPG games. Ideally, each player will have their chracter displayed on a tablet or smart phone, whilst the summary can be seen by everyone, displayed on a monitor or TV screen. Once these are set up, you  can just leave them; they will update automatically (every #{refreshRate} seconds).
  p The GM should go to the Encounter page on a laptop or desktop computer, and control everything from there.
