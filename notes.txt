  replace blue with cyan



Good things end at the start of the turn, bad at the end. therefore, delaying cannot be an advantage
Need to flag if turn start has been done so it does not happen twice (when delaying) and unflag at turn end

/encounter

Skip or act or attack or add NPCs

Skip drops char down the action list one place

Act has the char miss a turn (i.e., the action is resolved outside the system)

Attack needs a target, a roll, and a bonus
Save target, bonus defaults to 0

Add a custom character
Add a stock monster
Add a group
  All these need a way (set of rules) for adding to the turn system

Perhaps they should be aded after a character, all inserted at that point. Works for summoned.
